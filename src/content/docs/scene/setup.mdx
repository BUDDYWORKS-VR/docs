### Installing the Template
The installation process depends on which distribution you use.  
You need to import AudioLink and LTCGI beforehand if you plan to use them.  

## Installation

			2. After that, you can copy the data into your */Assets/* directory by using the toolbar menu:

 	<TabItem label=".unitypackage">
	>	Importing the Unitypackage will directly give you all data inside `/Assets/BUDDYWORKS/Avatar Scene`, you will need to open the scene yourself.
