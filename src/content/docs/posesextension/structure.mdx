### Parameters

##### Standalone
- **PE/Set [INT]:** Defines the currently picked pose set. (Like standing, sitting etc.)
- **PE/Float [Float]:** Used for pose selection and dance speed.
- **PE/Exit [Bool]:** *Unsynced* parameter used as condition placeholder for to-Exit transitions.

##### GGL Variant
- **InStation [Bool]:** *Unsynced* Default Parameter used by GGL for conditional checks.
- **PE/Exit [Bool]:** *Unsynced* Parameter used as condition placeholder for to-Exit transitions.
- **PE/Active [Bool]:** *Unsynced* Local condition ensuring the support logic is only run for PE functions.
- **Go/Float [Float]:** Similiar to PE/Float, used for any radial selections by GGL.
- **Go/VRCEmote [INT]:** GGL parameter that does pretty much everything. PE uses some of its pose-space.

### Action Layer

- **BUDDYWORKS Poses Extension - Poses&Dances:** Main Layer for the pose and emote logic.
- **BUDDYWORKS Poses Extension - Support Logic:** Additional layer, currently used for the bi-directional free-rotation radial.
