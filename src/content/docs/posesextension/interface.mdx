#### Interface with Poses Extension
Some cases, like blink handling, might require you to interface with Poses Extension.  
Poses Extension offers the following ways to interact with it in your own logic:  
- **PE/Set [Int]** = Currently selected pose bank. Use this to check whenever PE is active. 0 = Inactive, >0 = Active.
- **PE/Reset [Trigger/Bool]** = Will reset PE completely. Use with conflicting assets.
