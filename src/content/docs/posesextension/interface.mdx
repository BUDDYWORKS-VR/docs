#### Interface with Poses Extension
Some cases, like blink handling, might require you to interface with Poses Extension.  
Poses Extension offers the following ways to interact with it in your own logic:  

##### Read/Write
- **PE/Set [Int]** = Currently selected pose bank. Use this to check whenever PE is active. 0 = Inactive, >0 = Active.
- **PE/Reset [Trigger/Bool]** = Will reset PE completely. Use with conflicting assets.

##### Read only
- **PE/API/isActive [Bool]** = Returns true if PE is active.
- **PE/API/isInstalled [Bool]** = Returns true if PE is installed. Use this in your own asset to detect PE presense.
- **PE/API/currentState [INT]** = Returns a value based on what PE is currently doing.  
0 = Inactive  
1 = Active (No ViewAdjust)  
2 = Active (ViewAdjust)  
3 = Disengaging
