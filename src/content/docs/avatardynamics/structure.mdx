### FX Controller
#### Effect Layers
![Structure of the effect layers, they are the same for both noseboop and headpat.](./img/003.webp)  
The controller makes heavy use of isLocal assumptions and will work different based on who is running it.  

**User (you):** Process contact-checks, run the animation for yourself and also set the parameter *AD/Noseboop* or *AD/Headpat* to true for a brief time.  

**Remote (others):** Listen for parameter *AD/Noseboop* or *AD/Headpat* to change, and run when that is true.

Remote does not perform contact checks, which makes it more reliable.

#### Sound Layer
![The sound effect layer for the noseboop.](./img/004.webp)  
Will run whenever parameter *AD/Noseboop* is true, play a sound and shuffle *AD/Random* once done playing.  
This is processed separately to ensure that you and remote players hear the same sound every time.


### Parameters

##### Main Parameters [synced or unsynced]
- **AD/Noseboop [Bool]:** Whenever the nose is booped. SFX listens to this value.

##### Support Parameters [always unsynced]

- **AD/Safety/Headpat [Bool]:** Determines whenever Headpats should work or not.
- **AD/Safety/AllowSelf [Bool]:** Controls whenever you can interact with yourself.
